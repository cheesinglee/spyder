Project Explorer
================

The project explorer plugin handles project management in Spyder with the 
following main features:
    * import from existing Pydev (Eclipse) or Spyder projects
    * add/remove project folders to/from Spyder's PYTHONPATH directly from 
      the context menu or manage these folders in a dedicated dialog box
    * multiple file selection (for all available actions: open, rename, delete,
    and so on)
    * file type filters
